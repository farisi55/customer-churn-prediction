# Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains code and resources for predicting customer churn in a business context. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers cease doing business with a company or stop using its services.

## Overview

Customer churn prediction is a crucial task for businesses across various industries, as it allows companies to identify customers who are likely to churn in the future. By predicting churn early, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers and prevent revenue loss.

## Contents

- **Data:** This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the churn prediction model. It includes historical customer data such as demographics, transaction history, usage patterns, etc.

- **Notebooks:** This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the process of data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference. Each notebook is accompanied by detailed explanations and comments.

- **Models:** This directory contains trained machine learning models for predicting customer churn. The models are serialized using popular libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow and can be easily loaded for inference.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/farisi55/customer-churn-prediction.git


2. **Install Dependencies:**
   pip install -r requirements.txt


3. **Explore the Notebooks:**
Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `Notebooks` directory to understand the process of churn prediction, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

4. **Train Your Own Models:**
Use the provided dataset and notebooks as a reference to train your own churn prediction models. Experiment with different algorithms, feature engineering techniques, and hyperparameters to improve model performance.

5. **Evaluate Model Performance:**
Evaluate the performance of your trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, etc.

6. **Make Predictions:**
Once you have a trained model, use it to make predictions on new data to identify customers at risk of churning. This can help your business take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.
